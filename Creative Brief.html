            <h2>Project Background</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Client:</b> Blockbuster</li>
                    <li><b>Product/Service:</b> Video Store</li>
                    <li><b>SWOT:</b><a href="analysis.html" target="blank"> SWOT Analysis</a></li>
                    <li><b>Existing Research:</b> According to <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/business/last-blockbuster-store.html" target="blank">The New York Times</a></em>
                        the world’s last Blockbuster still has several years left on it’s lease
                        and does not plan on closing anytime soon.
                        This store became the final location at the start of 
                        2019 after the second to last location closed in Australia. 
                        On <a href="https://twitter.com/blockbuster?lang=en" target="blank">Blockbuster’s Twitter</a> account they also announced the
                        opportunity to experience a 90s themed sleepover for four guests on limited dates of Sept. 18-20</li>
                    <li><b>Date:</b> September 17, 2020</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Project type:</b> Website Redesign</li>
                    <li><b>Reason for Project:</b> To redesign the outdated website for Blockbuster by driving attention towards the one of a kind
                         store located in Bend, Oregon. We are revitalizing the homepage to highlight the location of the last store. This will increase 
                         awareness of the business’ existence and peak fans interest in the opportunity to rent out the location. 
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Opportunities:</b> One opportunity is to provide Blockbuster fans the chance to visit the last physical
                         location in Bend, Oregon. Another is the chance to participate in a 90s themed sleepover for one night. 
                         One more opportunity we can take advantage of is the experience of video shopping as a family or a date and the memories that Blockbuster creates. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <h2>Drivers</h2>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Goals:</b> To increase awareness of the last store location of Blockbuster by promoting profit 
                        generating traffic. We plan to breath life back into the dying trend of video rental by getting 
                        customers excited about the experience with a new online presence. 
                    </li>
